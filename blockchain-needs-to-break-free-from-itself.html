         <h2>Blockchain Needs To Break Free From Itself</h2>
         <p><em>Originally published on September 8th, 2024</em></p>
         <article>
            <p><strong>Crypto has a problem. It’s that we’re all building for nerds.</strong></p>
            <p>No seriously, I’m not kidding. I think when it comes to blockchain-based products, developers tend to lose touch with real consumers and who their audience should be. <strong>Instead, they build what <em>they</em> think is cool.</strong></p>
            <p>This can work in some cases, and I understand the intentions behind it. But it often leads to situations where people take a product that at face value could be valuable and turn it into some over-engineered, sloppily put-together thing that nobody, outside of the nerdiest of crypto nerds, actually wants to use.</p>
            <p>I used to work in music. I did cover art, consulted on marketing campaigns for album rollouts, and helped creatively direct these launches. Something I heard often was that male artists should play their music for women pre-release to see what they think before finalizing the track list. I think this is sage advice, because many people drink their own kool-aid to the point where they lose the plot and end up putting out music that only a small crowd wants to hear.</p>
            <p>This isn’t a problem if you don’t care how many listeners you have, but most artists <em>do</em> care. <strong>They want to make an impact, and to do that, you need to appeal to a larger audience.</strong> It’s the same problem we see in crypto. People spend years in this industry, build a product, and talk about it with all their crypto friends. Then they advertise it on crypto podcasts and Twitter Spaces, go to crypto conferences to sell it to other people in the industry (who are only there to sell their products to you too, but that’s another story).</p>
            <p>See the problem?</p>
            <p>There’s an echo chamber, and it’s been discussed before, but I think it’s worth revisiting. One project that perfectly exemplifies this phenomenon is Farcaster. The base idea behind it is interesting — an open, decentralized social network that people can build on top of. That’s cool, but functionally, because of how the core team is moving, <strong>the only audience interested in it right now is the nerdiest of crypto nerds.</strong></p>
            <p>Don’t get me wrong — I love crypto nerds, and I’m one of them too.</p>
            <p>But let’s be real. Social media networks are driven primarily by younger audiences, and a lot of it is driven by women. I’d love to see a demographic breakdown of Farcaster’s user base, especially in terms of age and gender. From my own anecdotal experience, I’d guess it leans heavily towards men, and most are over 25. <strong>This is a problem, you aren’t going to build a cultural powerhouse of a social media network that way.</strong></p>
            <p>I point this out because I care about the idea of decentralized social networks. I think there’s a lot of potential societal benefits to this sort of product becoming widely used, but this is negated if the product doesn’t actually get used. Farcaster is incredibly well-capitalized, and they have the runway to take the time to figure this out. Dan’s a sharp guy, and they’re perfectly capable of righting the ship.</p>
            <p>I’m not even totally sure what the solution is, but it <strong><em>has</em></strong> to start with stepping outside the bubble. Farcaster and similar projects need to break out of their echo chambers. <strong>They need to talk to people who don’t live and breathe crypto 24/7,</strong> people that aren’t venture capitalists or tech industry veterans.</p>
            <p>Look, I don’t have all the answers, but it’s clear that the current approach is too narrow. <strong>These products aren’t just being built in a bubble — they’re being marketed and launched there too.</strong> It’s easy to think your product is groundbreaking when all your feedback comes from the same group of crypto-native users, but that limits growth.</p>
            <p>If Farcaster, and blockchain products in general, want real, lasting impact, they need to start talking to mainstream creators and users. <strong>Spend time with the people who shape culture on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter.</strong> Find out what they love, what frustrates them, and what would genuinely improve their experience. <strong>It’s not about dumbing down the tech; it’s about expanding the vision.</strong></p>
            <p>Crypto and decentralization <em>can</em> offer something radically new and valuable —<strong> but if the audience is limited to the nerdiest corner of the internet, then what’s the point?</strong></p>
            <p>Farcaster has the potential to be something big. They have the runway, the resources, and the right idea. The question is whether they’ll take the time to get out of the bubble, understand the real problems people face with today’s platforms, and <strong>build something that doesn’t just excite developers but genuinely <em>delights</em> users.</strong></p>
            <p>And this isn’t just about them — this is about every blockchain product out there. Developers across crypto need to take a step back and ask themselves who they’re really building for. If the answer is just their peers or the hardcore crypto crowd, then they’re missing the bigger picture.</p>
            <p><strong>The future of decentralized tech depends on breaking out of this bubble.</strong></p>
            <p>That means collaborating with people outside of crypto. <strong>Start looking at feedback from creators who actively shape culture and consumer behavior on major social platforms </strong>— people who may not even care about crypto but who understand what drives engagement and keeps users coming back. Partner with influencers and creators outside the tech space. Test your products with people who use social media as part of their everyday life, whether they’re consumers, content creators, or marketers. <strong>These are the users who will help you understand how to build something that resonates beyond the crypto echo chamber.</strong></p>
            <p>It’s time to build for the world, not just for crypto.</p>
