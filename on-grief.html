         <h2>On Grief</h2>

            <p><strong>Most people give terrible advice when it comes to grief.</strong></p>
            <p>That’s a bit harsh, let me take a step back. It’s really not terrible advice, and I am immensely thankful to the people I had in my corner who did their best to help.</p>
            <p>Much of the advice you get after a significant loss is very kind, thoughtful and sweet — it comes from a good place, but it’s not conducive to you actually moving on and resolving the underlying issues.</p>
            <p>My mom passed on July 23rd, and it put me in a very dark place. Our relationship was complicated, and a lot of things went unspoken or unresolved. This made things even more difficult, and it’s something I’m still grappling with. I spent about a month, a little over a month actually, just moping around, and only just recently broke out of that cycle.</p>
            <p>I kept hearing variations on the advice of:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>“Be patient with yourself.”  </li>
               <li>“It’s okay to not feel okay.”  </li>
               <li>“Take all the time you need.”  </li>
               <li>“Everyone grieves differently.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Honestly, it is good to hear this. To a certain extent, I think some people might need it. There are many people out there that don’t deal with their emotions in the way they should, and they run away from them. I’m not advocating for that, you should take the time to cry, feel what you’re feeling, and think through what it means for your life.</p>
            <p>I really need to underscore that again, because the rest of what I have to say builds on top of you actually really working through this emotionally. <strong>You should take the time to cry, feel what you’re feeling, and think through what it means for your life. None of this advice matters unless you’re still doing your best to process everything emotionally.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Momentum is so important though.</strong> It’s extremely easy to get wrapped up in a cycle of feeling sorry for yourself, of treading water or even just letting yourself drown. You can’t do that. <strong>At a certain point, you do have to try your best to take a step forward and <em>move.</em></strong> You don’t have to sprint yet, you don’t even have to jog.</p>
            <p>I’m going to give you some really generic advice that you’ve probably heard for many other things, but it’s evergreen for a reason. I’ll give you some other advice that was helpful for me in my own inner dialogue as well.</p>
            <p>You need to hit the gym. Clean up your diet, and do something hard. I don’t care what it is, but <strong>it has to be something you don’t really <em>want</em> to do</strong>, something you may feel a little bit physically uncomfortable doing.</p>
            <p><strong>Run. Lift. Swim.</strong></p>
            <p>I don’t care what it is, <strong>you just need to physically move,</strong> and to struggle with some part of it, feeling like you’re close to maximal effort. Eat good food too — a clean diet with as few processed foods as possible, and a high amount of protein. <strong>Treat your body well physically, and I promise the mental part will become more malleable,</strong> it will be easier to hold it together when you still feel like falling apart.</p>
            <p>Here’s where it gets a little more personal, and may diverge from the experience you’ve had with your own grief. I fell into a whole existential crisis. The death of a parent is so different from anything else that I’ve faced, and I didn’t know how to deal with it. It made me face my own mortality in a way that thus far, I hadn’t. <strong>I came face to face with these thoughts of what I’m here for, what my goals truly are, and many doubts as to whether I’m taking the steps I need to take to achieve them.</strong></p>
            <p>In hindsight, as I’ve now been grappling with this for a few weeks, I think this is pretty normal. This article is going to be somewhat of a work in progress, because for this point in particular, I don’t think I have all the answers yet — I’ll probably write a part two at some point, or maybe make revisions. It’s still in progress, and I guess part of me hopes that by writing this I will find the answer. Maybe writing this is even part of that?</p>
            <p>So far though, I’ve listened to many podcasts, I’ve tried to broaden my perspective by reading, and I’ve talked with friends for hours on end about this war I’m waging internally with my own mind. I started to write more, both code and regular words. This feels good, but I don’t necessarily know what it will lead to later down the road.</p>
            <p>It’s a bit ironic, but I find myself wanting to bring up some of the advice I was admonishing earlier in the article. <strong>I want to tell you to be kind to yourself, to be patient with yourself.</strong> You don’t have to have it figured out immediately, and I think in the midst of that sort of existential crisis, you really <em>do</em> feel like you should have it figured out, but that’s just not the case.</p>
            <p>Let yourself explore the world, and the possibilities in front of you with a sense of childlike wonder and curiosity. Try to open up your eyes to all the options you have ahead of you, and think hard on which ones you’d like to explore, then just move. <strong>Keep the momentum going, and try anything that sounds like it may be interesting.</strong> Give it a real effort though, <strong>don’t just try shit without finishing it.</strong></p>
            <p>I hope that someone stumbles upon this when they’re in the same spot that I was a month ago. If even one person that really needs it happens to read this, and takes the advice to heart, it would have been worthwhile for me to sit down and dump this from my brain to the page it now resides on.</p>
            <p>To wrap this up, you need to move. Physically, but mentally as well. Keep the momentum going, and <strong>don’t allow yourself to tread water for so long that you end up drowning.</strong> </p>
            <p>It might feel like this is ruining you, but it isn’t. I promise.</p>
            <p>Do something physical, it doesn’t matter what. <strong>It should be hard though, maybe even a bit uncomfortable.</strong> Try new things, and put real effort into them. Similarly to the exercise, <strong>it doesn’t matter what these things are as long as you get genuine fulfillment out of them.</strong> </p>
            <p>Eat clean too. Put good things into your body, be physically kind to yourself and you will feel better, even if it is a marginal difference.</p>
            <p>I think I probably wrote this just as much for me as I did for this future reader I am envisioning. I hope this helps though. If this did strike a chord, and you’re in the same spot I was a month ago, <strong>just know that you will be okay.</strong> This is all temporary, and as long as you take the right steps you will come out of it even stronger than you were before.</p>
            <p>Note:</p>
            <p>I just finished writing this, and I don’t want to add anything more to it or revise. I think it gets my thoughts across clearly and I stand on everything I said. That being said though, I did forget something very important. It was strangely timed, but I read Tuesdays With Morrie about a week before my mom passed, and I’m immensely grateful for that. I can’t recommend that book enough, and I think a lot of the lessons in that book are incredibly valuable to digest in a time of mourning as well.</p>
            <p>This book speaks a lot to the idea of building and nurturing the community around you, of the importance of family, of love, and other extremely important things like this. I could write a whole article on this part, but instead I’d really like to implore you to read the book. Mitch Alborn, the writer, did a much better job than I possibly could synthesizing all of these lessons into one spot.</p>
