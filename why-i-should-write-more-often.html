        <h2>Why I Should Write More Often (And You Should Too)</h2>
        <p><em>Originally published on March 23rd, 2024</em></p>

        <article>
            <p>I’m not writing this for you.</p>

            <p>No seriously, if you read it - that’s great. But more than anything this is a letter to myself.</p>

            <p>This is a love letter to writing, and a dedication to attempting to do it more often.</p>

            <p>I consume a lot of content around startups, investing, emerging tech, etc. Anyone who follows me on Twitter knows this, most of what I post about these days revolves either around crypto, AI or some other form of emerging tech. </p>
            
            <p> I find it really fascinating, and as my full time job is in crypto as well I can cope about how my disgusting amount of screen time on Twitter is ‘research’.</p>

            <p>Most of it, unfortunately, is not that.</p>

            <p>That being said though, one of the things I see many of the people I greatly respect have in common, whether they be brilliant investors, borderline genius founders & builders in emerging tech, or simply commentators on the sidelines, is that they are for the most part all great at writing.</p>

            <p>I think there’s a couple different reasons for this.</p>

            <p>It’s a great way to gather your thoughts, if you’re attempting to disseminate heaps of information from a platform like Twitter it helps to sit down and try to make some sense of the information you’re consuming. </p>

            <p>It’s helpful for building an audience. Whether you want to persuade, evoke an emotion, or find people who have common interests, you have to put yourself out there in some form. That could be creating things people find interesting, sharing content they want to consume, giving your commentary on current events—but the best flywheel for a lot of these is writing, whether it be in short or long form. </p>

            <p>I know these things, and I’ve internalized them deeply at this point. I do still try and sit down to write about things I find interesting, or things I’m attempting to learn about/wrap my head around. </p>
            
            <p>Especially if it’s some sort of complex technical subject I only halfway understand, it helps to write about it so I can figure out what gaps I have in my knowledge, then I can research to fill those gaps and finish writing what I want to write. </p>
            
            <p>I did this a few times last summer with various topics in crypto, and I’ve started a few other articles along these same lines that have never seen the light of day. </p>

            <p>That being said though, I’d like to do it more often. I’ve been watching a lot of this podcast, ‘My First Million', and the video I most recently watched was a persuasive podcast on why you should write more. I’ve already been thinking about sitting down to write this, but this video really pushed me to do it, in hopes that by taking the time to commit this to paper, and publicly release it, it would help me hold myself accountable.</p>

            <p>If you like to learn, and you want to learn more effectively, or you’re attempting to grow in some way, I’d encourage you to do the same. You don’t have to publish what you write, but maybe you can try doing what I’m attempting. </p>
            
            <p> I don’t know that I’m going to publicly publish all of these, but I do think I’m going to try to take notes throughout the week on the subjects I find most interesting, then on some predetermined day/time I’m going to sit down for a few hours, set a timer, and force myself to make something distilling the thoughts I had on the subject of choice. </p> 
            
            <p> You might have guessed this by now, but for this first installment that subject of choice was writing, and why more people should practice this discipline.</p>

            <p>To further persuade you in considering this, I’d like to share a little bit about how writing more often (even though I admittedly still don’t do it enough) has helped me over the last year or so.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I’ve gotten some freelance writing work, even though I don’t feel my portfolio is particularly strong—thankfully, my clients seem to disagree with that.</li>
                <li>I’ve learned a lot, as I said sometimes I can struggle with more complex, technical subjects and writing about them when I have a partial understanding really helps with better digesting information, as well as understanding the gaps in my knowledge.</li>
                <li>This is subjective, but I’d like to think I’ve become a better communicator in both my personal and professional life. I can communicate more clearly, a bit more concisely, and I know for a fact I can better illustrate the points I’m attempting to make.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>There’s more to it than these quick notes, but they’re the main bullet points I want to underline. You could probably benefit from all of those too, or maybe in other ways you and I can’t even predict in this moment. It’s worth sitting down and journaling as an exercise even—collecting your thoughts and writing about personal events in your life so you can better understand how you feel about everything going on, and what you might want to do to better work towards your goals, whatever they may be.</p>

            <p>Even if you don’t decide to pick this up, I would at least encourage you to put some thought into how you could benefit from this practice if you do. Maybe you can even pen your own version of this essay, thinking deeply about what you would ideally want from writing more.</p>

            <p>I’ve been sitting here working on this for about 45 minutes now, and I can feel the flow state ending. I don’t think I have much else to say, besides one last affirmation that I would like to do this more often. I’m unsure how often I’ll share the things I write, but when I do feel comfortable publishing them, it will be on this new Substack. Feel free to subscribe if you’d like, that way you can read the next installation.</p>

            <p>For now though, I’d just like to implore you to think more deeply about the knowledge and media you consume, then take some time occasionally to distill that into words on a page. Who knows what you’ll get out of it, but I promise it’ll be good for you in the long run—you might even find some enjoyment out of it too.</p>
